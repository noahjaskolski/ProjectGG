        <h1>Welcome to Level 1</h1>
        <p>To Understand what Bash scripting is, you need to understand some key terms: shell, terminal, the Linux Operating System, and Bash. Keep in mind that Bash scripting is a powerful tool to create "programs", but there are fundamentals to be learned. </p>
        
        <p>Let's start with the shell which is a command
            interpreter program that takes commands in a terminal and passes the commands to the operating system to
            perform. A terminal, also known as terminal emulator, is a program that acts like a wrapper for the shell. This can be seen as a GUI (Graphical User Interface) or a CLI (Command Line Interface. This allows you to access the shell via the command line. It is basically the user interface to the computer's operating system. Linux is the open source Unix-like operating system developed by Linus Torvalds. There are many different distributions of Linux which are likened to flavors of the Linux OS with different enhancements and features. Some popular distributions include Ubuntu, Kali, Fedora, Red Hat, etc.  </p>

        <p>The Bourne shell was written by Stephen Bourne as an upgrade to the original Thompson shell. The term Bash is
            an acryonym for the Bourne-Again SHell which is a command language interpreter. It came into
            existence when the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html">GNU project</a> sought to make a free Unix clone operating system combined with the Bourne
            shell.</p>
        
        <p>Bash scripting is a text file that contains a series of commands that is to run tasks automatically when executed. It can save a tremendous amount of type or remove user error when entering commands in the terminal. We will learn more about this later.</p>
        <p>Okay enough history, in this level you will learn about several commands that are helpful. </p>

        <h3>Commands:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>date-->provides today's date</li>
            <li>pwd-->shows you the power working directory which is where you are in file system</li>
            <li>ls-->lists all the files based on where you are at in the file structure </li>
            <li>ls -l -->provides additional information for each of the files, such as file or directory</li>
            <li>man bash-->this shows the bash manual page. The man command can be used to be the manual page for any program</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, in the terminal start by typing each of the commands and observe the outpput.</p>
        <p>**Challenge: enter echo $SHELL...what returned?</p>
        <!--enter answer here and checks to see if bin/bash-->
